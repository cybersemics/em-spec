  - Metaprogramming
    - Description
      - My biggest breakthrough with em recently is the discovery and initial formalization of metaprogramming in em. That is, programming from within em itself self-reflectively operating on the content of em. With metaprogramming, features of em can be implemented in em: Settings is just another context with thoughts like ‚ÄúTheme‚Äù it ‚ÄúFont Size‚Äù that can be edited directly. Recently Edited Thoughts is just another context. It‚Äôs similar to how Search already works, except I am adding templates, type validation, and command triggers so that users can create their own dynamic and interactive contexts. This moves closer to the vision of em‚Äôs contextual data model as a universal sensemaking structure.

        - Yet they do not want to lose the information of the subcategory
        - Therefore they should be able to collapse the subcategory, resulting in a flat list of thoughts, each with the subcategory as a (potentially floating) context
        - What is the storage representation?
        - Is this a change in storage  representation or view?

    - Definition
      - A (simulated) semantic operation is a digital simulacrum of a cognitive operation (mind), contrasted with an editing operation (machine).
      - A structuring operation is a specific, necessary type of editing operation that converts prose to semantic structure

          - Description
            - A random item sparks other thoughts which are added underneath
            - Then you realize that the sparking thought shouldn't be the root category, but belongs to another subcategory such as Description or Instances.
            - This operation prompts you to:
              - 1) Create a new containing category
              - 2) Bump the sparking thought into a subcategory
              - 3) Define a new subcategory for the children
            - Similar to Bump Parent but creates additional intermediary categories

          - First, let me show you how to create a new thought in em using a swipe gesture.
          - Trace the line below with your finger to create a new thought.
        - Type Thought
          - You did it! Now enter a thought. Anything will do.

        - Intro
          - If the same thought appears in more than one place, em shows a small number to the right of the thought.
          - It looks like this: pancake^3
          - Let‚Äôs see this in action.
          - ‚úó
            - This helps you see how your thoughts are connected
        - Create
          - First create a subthought ‚ÄúTodo‚Äù inside one of your pre-existing thoughts.
          - It‚Äôs okay if it doesn‚Äôt make sense. We‚Äôre just setting up the correct structure for our example.
        - Subthought
          - Now add an item to ‚ÄúTodo‚Äù
          - Do you remember the gesture? hint
        - Subthought in Root
          - Ah, I see what you did. You added ‚ÄúTodo‚Äù to the home screen.
          - That makes sense, but for this tutorial, add ‚ÄúTodo‚Äù to one of your existing thoughts so that we have the correct structure to proceed.
        - Duplicate Thought
          - Now things are going to get interesting.
          - Try creating another subthought ‚ÄúTodo‚Äù in a different thought.
        - Same Context
          - Oops! We need to add ‚ÄúTodo‚Äù to a different thought in order for this tutorial to make sense.
          - One way to remedy this would be to  drag ‚ÄúTodo‚Äù to ‚Äúx‚Äù. You could also create a brand new ‚ÄúTodo‚Äù subthought.
          - I‚Äôll wait.
        - Multiple Contexts
          - Very good!
          - Notice the number ‚Äú2‚Äù. This means that ‚ÄúTodo‚Äù appears under two different thoughts: ‚Äúa‚Äù and ‚Äúb‚Äù.
          - Add an item to this second Todo list.
        - Context View Start
          - Now imagine that you had hundreds and hundreds of thoughts, and you wanted to see what was in your other Todo list without having to search though everything or leave your current thought.
          - [Tap on ‚ÄúTodo‚Äù] and swipe ‚Üí‚Üë
        - Context View Open
          - Well, look at that. Both Todo lists in one place. You can even view the first Todo item you created by tapping on ‚Äúa‚Äù.
          - There are no manual links in em. Simply type a thought, and it is automatically linked to every other identical thought.
        - Conclusion
          - Here are some real-world examples of linked thoughts:
            - Multiple occurrences of a person‚Äôs name
            - Keeping track of ‚ÄúQuestions‚Äù across multiple categories.
            - Creating a link on the home screen to a deeply nested subthought.
          - The more thoughts you add to em, the more useful this feature will become.
        - Conclusion II
          - Congratulations! You have completed the Linked Thoughts tutorial.
          - You now have the skills to create a vast web of thoughts in em.

      - Forcing the user to know the type/instance distinction makes it much more likely that it increases cognitive capacity
        - Something must happen if it is necessarily novel
        - Constraint breeds creativity
      - Force plural types?
      - Force no instances in instances?
      - Maps to context-dependent/independent distinction
      - If they are mutually applicable without constraint, what benefit do they provide?
        - Maybe just identifying singletons (context independent) is useful enough
        - A gradual spectrum of ontological force
      - Lists (instances) vs Carvings (aspects)
        - Open vs Closed

    - False Cognates
    - Hypotheses
      - ?
        - Instances must be uncountable, globally unique singletons
        - Lists may be heterogeneous
          - Example
            - Art (instance)
            - Books (type)
        - Unique
        - Food is an instance
        - Free Composition
        - Non uniques are types

          - Names
            - Unique instances
            - Singleton
            - Unique
            - Context Independent
          - When nonuniques appear in multiple contexts, they refer to different (disparate) things
          - Context dependence (type-of) relationships may stretch across levels
          - Uniques undermine the meaning of multiple contexts
            - A unique in multiple contexts refers to the SAME reference
            - A non unique...
              - which is none other than a type
            - ...in multiple contexts refers to DIFFERENT references
        - Uniques undermine the meaning of multiple contextsa

        - A leaf is an instance; a nonleaf is a type
          - Counter examples:
            - You can always comment (loose associate) on a leaf, turning it into a nonleaf, which doesn‚Äôt change it
            - You can stop writing at any time, but it is more typical to stop on an instance

    - Fractal Overlap
      - Like a melody sung in a "round"
      - Continuous zoom requires fractal overlap at each level, i.e. always size 1
        - Size of fracteme = # levels before repeat
      - Focus size = # visible levels
        - Unifocus
        - Multifocus
      - Rendering function must know how to transition any visual level to its visual superlevel
      - How to overlap across different forms?
    - Peer layout function
      - General function to transition between isomorphisms
      - Each signifier has an expansion function that defines:
        - Point of departure for assocemes
        - Spatial translation of peers
    - Structure-agnostic network of ideas
      - I realized that em is not just a content-agnostic structure, but a structure-agnostic network of ideas.
      - &nbsp;
      - You should be able to easily switch between forms/isomorphisms
      - There is an invariant of relationality tying together content fractally. I think I need to develop a fractal navigation protocol based on focus and associativity.

      - Autoscroll
        - Better to scroll siblings into view, parents, vertically centered, or no scroll?
        - Mobile users are used to manual scrolling
        - False negative better than false positive
      - Expand all descendants that fit on screen
        - Sometimes results in extraneous depth
          - Example
            - A
            - B
            - C
              - Long note about C that really shouldn‚Äôt be expanded all the time even if there is room.
            - D
              - Technical text pasted from website etc
      - Fade out levels that haven't been touched in a while
        - False positive
          - Keeping open for reference
        - False negative
          - Too slow
      - Expand grandchildren if that level is complete
        - i.e. all items at that level have a child
      - Mixed expand/collapse
        - There are many use cases for both expanded and collapsed nodes at the same level
        - I am often working at one level while jumping in and out of children
        - Sometimes I want to see two siblings expanded

    - Description
      - A parent may derive it's meaning from situating its children
      - within
      - a sentence, i.e. bookends
      - Start fragment
        - Ends with an ellipsis...
      - End fragment
        - ...starts with an ellipsis
        - Rendered under the children
        - Same indentation as parent
        - No bullet
    - Editing
      - Hitting enter twice after an ellipsis splits it into an infix item
        - And places the cursor in the end fragment after the ellipsis
    - Example
      - By examining the...
        - faculties
        - activities
      - ...of the mind
  - Intersectional Categories #keyconcept

      - Ontological linking (identity) is not sufficient

          - e.g. Todo
        - Contract Independent
          - Case 2: Same signifier, same content everywhere
          - e.g. Cybersemics
        - Note: Context Type is not (pre)determined by item identity but by usage
          - e.g. in the context of Journaling, Cybersemics may be context dependent (i.e. a category of journal entries related to Cybersemics that day), but the default expected behavior when writing Cybersemics still its context free form

            - Too noisy
            - Not amenable to rotational panning
            - Doesn't mirror horizontal panning
          - Parent ellipsis
            - Display ellipsis at the end of the parent of the currently selected item
            - ‚úó confusing that ellipsis and superscript are on different elements
          - Swipe right edge of screen
            - Better reserved for more frequent action
      - Observations
        - Separate menu is too cumbersome and is not compatible with switching in-place
        - No menu lacks information
        - Most indexically represented as a sideways/horizontal shift
        - Navigate to specific context instead of rotating in the dark
        - Hide other contexts by default; too distracting
        - Might as well display all children when viewing all contexts; just displaying the titles isn't enough information

    - Description &amp; Terminology
      - Nodes can have multiple parent nodes
      - Only one parent node is shown at a time (similar to the sole parent in a traditional bulleted list)
      - Specialized controls are provided to navigate to new parents or modify parents
      - Parent nodes are referred to as the "context" of child nodes.
    - #Examples
      - You are reading a book (which is under /Books/ or /School/Naropa/'08-09/) and discover a connection to a previous topic. You should be able to record the connection such that it does not belong exclusively to either topic. #writing
      - You want to mark a topic for later research. "Marking" a topic can be modeled as adding it to a "To Research" context.
      - &nbsp;
      - /Home/Residences/Eaton St should appear at the top of /Home when it is my current residence for easy access
      - /em/Animations should contain all Animation subcategories in /em/Commands
      - Commitments or Active Projects top-level category contains deeply nested topic
      - &nbsp;
      - Todo list
      - Journal should be subdivided into em and Philosophy
      - You are modeling a security protocol at your job and you have a question about one step. You should be able to seamlessly add that step to Work + Questions

    - (Micro)Diachronic Semantics
      - Trace the development/evolution/unfolding/ontogeny of concepts
      - Concepts are subsumed/cannibalized, leaving a trace
      - Boundaries/scopes can be established between sessions/temporal clusters
        - Explicit or implicit
      - Unsubsumed concepts/subconcepts are preserved, although become either incorporated or fossilized in relation to living concepts
