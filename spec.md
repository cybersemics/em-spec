          - Bubbles or other containers add bulk; use space
          - Indentation efficiently communicates hierarchy
          - Each item needs a bullet or card to differentiate multi-line items

        - Description        
          - Sometimes you have two categories at the same level (logical type) but you want one category to be implicit and display all its children directly under the supercategory

  - Metaprogramming  
    - Description    
      - My biggest breakthrough with em recently is the discovery and initial formalization of metaprogramming in em. That is, programming from within em itself self-reflectively operating on the content of em. With metaprogramming, features of em can be implemented in em: Settings is just another context with thoughts like “Theme” it “Font Size” that can be edited directly. Recently Edited Thoughts is just another context. It’s similar to how Search already works, except I am adding templates, type validation, and command triggers so that users can create their own dynamic and interactive contexts. This moves closer to the vision of em’s contextual data model as a universal sensemaking structure.

        - After grouping a list of thoughts by subcategory, the user may find at a later date that the subcategory is not the primary way in which they want to view the thoughts
        - Yet they do not want to lose the information of the subcategory

          - First, let me show you how to create a new thought in em using a swipe gesture.
          - Trace the line below with your finger to create a new thought.        
        - Type Thought        
          - You did it! Now enter a thought. Anything will do.
          - Continue button          
            - You haven’t entered anything yet. I want to make sure you can enter a thought before we move on.                  
        - New Thought - Repeat        
          - Good work! Try creating a few more thoughts to get the hang of it.

      - Contexts      
        - Intro        
          - If the same thought appears in more than one place, em shows a small number to the right of the thought.
          - It looks like this: pancake^3
          - Let’s see this in action.
          - ✗          
            - This helps you see how your thoughts are connected                  
        - Create        
          - First create a subthought “Todo” inside one of your pre-existing thoughts.
          - It’s okay if it doesn’t make sense. We’re just setting up the correct structure for our example.        
        - Subthought        
          - Now add an item to “Todo”
          - Do you remember the gesture? hint        
        - Subthought in Root        
          - Ah, I see what you did. You added “Todo” to the home screen. 
          - That makes sense, but for this tutorial, add “Todo” to one of your existing thoughts so that we have the correct structure to proceed.        
        - Duplicate Thought        
          - Now things are going to get interesting.
          - Try creating another subthought “Todo” in a different thought.        
        - Same Context        
          - Oops! We need to add “Todo” to a different thought in order for this tutorial to make sense.
          - One way to remedy this would be to  drag “Todo” to “x”. You could also create a brand new “Todo” subthought.
          - I’ll wait.        
        - Multiple Contexts        
          - Very good!
          - Notice the number “2”. This means that “Todo” appears under two different thoughts: “a” and “b”.
          - Add an item to this second Todo list.        
        - Context View Start        
          - Now imagine that you had hundreds and hundreds of thoughts, and you wanted to see what was in your other Todo list without having to search though everything or leave your current thought.
          - [Tap on “Todo”] and swipe →↑        
        - Context View Open        
          - Well, look at that. Both Todo lists in one place. You can even view the first Todo item you created by tapping on “a”.
          - There are no manual links in em. Simply type a thought, and it is automatically linked to every other identical thought.        
        - Conclusion        
          - Here are some real-world examples of linked thoughts:          
            - Multiple occurrences of a person’s name
            - Keeping track of “Questions” across multiple categories.
            - Creating a link on the home screen to a deeply nested subthought.          
          - The more thoughts you add to em, the more useful this feature will become.        
        - Conclusion II        
          - Congratulations! You have completed the Linked Thoughts tutorial.
          - You now have the skills to create a vast web of thoughts in em.

      - Forcing the user to know the type/instance distinction makes it much more likely that it increases cognitive capacity      
        - Something must happen if it is necessarily novel
        - Constraint breeds creativity      
      - Force plural types?
      - Force no instances in instances?
      - Maps to context-dependent/independent distinction
      - If they are mutually applicable without constraint, what benefit do they provide?      
        - Maybe just identifying singletons (context independent) is useful enough
        - A gradual spectrum of ontological force      
      - Lists (instances) vs Carvings (aspects)      
        - Open vs Closed

    - False Cognates
    - Hypotheses    
      - ?      
        - Instances must be uncountable, globally unique singletons
        - Lists may be heterogeneous        
          - Example          
            - Art (instance)
            - Books (type)                  
        - Unique
        - Food is an instance
        - Free Composition
        - Non uniques are types
        - Uniques        
          - Names          
            - Unique instances
            - Singleton
            - Unique
            - Context Independent          
          - When nonuniques appear in multiple contexts, they refer to different (disparate) things
          - Context dependence (type-of) relationships may stretch across levels
          - Uniques undermine the meaning of multiple contexts          
            - A unique in multiple contexts refers to the SAME reference
            - A non unique...            
              - which is none other than a type            
            - ...in multiple contexts refers to DIFFERENT references

          - Counter examples:          
            - You can always comment (loose associate) on a leaf, turning it into a nonleaf, which doesn’t change it

        - Option A: pin single item open
        - Option B: pin all children open
        - On any given editing session there is a "root" node which I don't need to see above        
          - But you can't infer what is the root when jumping around

    - Archive    
      - Autoscroll      
        - Better to scroll siblings into view, parents, vertically centered, or no scroll?
        - Mobile users are used to manual scrolling
        - False negative better than false positive      
      - Expand all descendants that fit on screen      
        - Sometimes results in extraneous depth        
          - Example          
            - A
            - B
            - C            
              - Long note about C that really shouldn’t be expanded all the time even if there is room.            
            - D            
              - Technical text pasted from website etc                                    
      - Fade out levels that haven't been touched in a while      
        - False positive        
          - Keeping open for reference        
        - False negative        
          - Too slow              
      - Expand grandchildren if that level is complete      
        - i.e. all items at that level have a child      
      - Mixed expand/collapse      
        - There are many use cases for both expanded and collapsed nodes at the same level
        - I am often working at one level while jumping in and out of children
        - Sometimes I want to see two siblings expanded
